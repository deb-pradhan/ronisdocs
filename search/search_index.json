We are following how the wallets are transacting which results in collecting inferences about the market direction. We have used this on BTC, ETH, USDT, Bitfinex BTC and top holders for them. We track the addresses to see if they are dumping or buying their assets. Similarly, we see Bitfinex BTC Cold Wallets as we know cold wallets are nothing but storages, this will help us get the transaction between exchanges and wallets. If there is a huge value movement between wallets and exchanges this has an enormous impact on Price Action - This is what we target to find whether it\u2019s a good period to buy or sell.","title":"Wallet Analysis"},{"location":"Products/p1Wallet%20Analysis/#wallet-analysis","text":"In this project we are trying to follow the wallets with top balances and token level.

The NFT collections we targeted are: Crypto Punks Bored Ape Yacht Club Mutant Ape Yacht Club Art Blocks Decentraland A non-fungible token (NFT) is a non-interchangeable unit of data stored on a blockchain, a form of digital ledger, which can be sold and traded. Since NFT data is stored on blockchain, no one can amend data. Opensea is a popular NFT marketplace where we can trade NFTs. Opensea have lot of NFT collections in art, music, video, etc. Every collection may have considerable number of NFTs. Therefore, analysing the collection level data and collectors level data for every collection in Opensea has become huge use case in recent times.","title":"NFT Analysis"},{"location":"Products/p2NftAnalysis/#nft-analysis","text":"In this project we would analyse the NFT transaction data of some top collections and build different metrics for getting better insights for developing NFTs and for traders.

In its simplest form, blockchain is a vast and complex series of transaction events between entities. Those events \u2013 or connections \u2013 are easier to understand when they\u2019re presented in an interactive, tangible format. Presenting blockchain data as graph and timeline visualizations makes it accessible and comprehensible. Users can filter through the transactions based on value, date, sender, and receiver of the transaction. It helps analysts reveal patterns of unusual activity hidden in high traffic volumes, as well as drill down to understand the details of individual transactions. For Neutrino, we have used D3.js a JavaScript library for producing dynamic, interactive data visualizations in web browsers. It makes use of Scalable Vector Graphics, HTML5, and Cascading Style Sheets standards. We have categorized all the nodes as Exchanges, Decentralized exchanges, senders and receivers. This makes it easier to interpret and track historical transactions. Neutrino is able to visualize more than 1000 transactions at a time giving a more in-depth view compared to other visualization tools on the internet.","title":"Neutrino"},{"location":"Products/p3Neutrino/#neutrino","text":"Neutrino is an advanced visualization tool for displaying the networked nature of Bitcoin.
