# Wallet Analysis

![walelt analysis header](\assets\1.png)

In this project we are trying to follow the wallets with top balances and token level. We are
following how the wallets are transacting which results in collecting inferences about the
market direction. We have used this on BTC, ETH, USDT, Bitfinex BTC and top holders for
them.
We track the addresses to see if they are dumping or buying their assets.
Similarly, we see Bitfinex BTC Cold Wallets as we know cold wallets are nothing but
storages, this will help us get the transaction between exchanges and wallets.
If there is a huge value movement between wallets and exchanges this has an enormous
impact on Price Action - This is what we target to find whether itâ€™s a good period to buy or
sell.
