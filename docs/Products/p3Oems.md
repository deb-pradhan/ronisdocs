# OEMS

OEMS (Order Execution Management System) lets a user place orders on different
exchanges. A user can track and manage all his trades through a single system.

Monitoring the market manually and tracking the prices is a hectic job. To overcome this
issue, we use various automation tools. By using OEMS, one can manage all their accounts
on multiple exchange all under the same roof.

For OEMS we Initially started by implementing and mounting Frosty-Bot. About
Frostybot-JS is a cryptocurrency trading API endpoint, designed to execute webhook or
REST requests as orders on a variety of well-known exchanges.
While primarily designed to automate your Trading view strategies, Frosty bot can also be
integrated with any other software using webhooks or REST. Bitmex, FTX, Deribit and
Binance are supported.
