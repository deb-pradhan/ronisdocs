# NFT Analysis

In this project we would analyse the NFT transaction data of some top collections and build
different metrics for getting better insights for developing NFTs and for traders.
The NFT collections we targeted are:

* Crypto Punks
* Bored Ape Yacht Club
* Mutant Ape Yacht Club
* Art Blocks
* Decentraland

A non-fungible token (NFT) is a non-interchangeable unit of data stored on a blockchain, a
form of digital ledger, which can be sold and traded. Since NFT data is stored on
blockchain, no one can amend data. Opensea is a popular NFT marketplace where we can
trade NFTs.

Opensea have lot of NFT collections in art, music, video, etc. Every collection may have
considerable number of NFTs. Therefore, analysing the collection level data and collectors
level data for every collection in Opensea has become huge use case in recent times.
