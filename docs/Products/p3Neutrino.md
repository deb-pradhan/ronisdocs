Neutrino is an advanced visualization tool for displaying the networked nature of Bitcoin.

In its simplest form, blockchain is a vast and complex series of transaction events between
entities. Those events – or connections – are easier to understand when they’re presented
in an interactive, tangible format. Presenting blockchain data as graph and timeline
visualizations makes it accessible and comprehensible. Users can filter through the
transactions based on value, date, sender, and receiver of the transaction. It helps analysts
reveal patterns of unusual activity hidden in high traffic volumes, as well as drill down to
understand the details of individual transactions.

For Neutrino, we have used D3.js a JavaScript library for producing dynamic, interactive
data visualizations in web browsers. It makes use of Scalable Vector Graphics, HTML5, and
Cascading Style Sheets standards.

We have categorized all the nodes as Exchanges, Decentralized exchanges, senders and
receivers. This makes it easier to interpret and track historical transactions. Neutrino is able to visualize more than 1000 transactions at a time giving a more in-depth view compared to other visualization tools on the internet.
